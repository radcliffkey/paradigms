  abstract = {We present two methods for unsupervised segmentation of words into
    morpheme-like units. The model utilized is especially suited for
    languages with a rich morphology, such as Finnish. The first method
    is based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle and works
    online. In the second method, Maximum Likelihood (ML) optimization
    is used. The quality of the segmentations is measured using an evaluation
    method that compares the segmentations produced to an existing morphological
    analysis. Experiments on both Finnish and English corpora show that
    the presented methods perform well compared to a current state-of-the-art
    system.},

    data. Results of the linguistic evaluation of Morpho Challenge improve
    rapidly already with small amounts of labeled data, surpassing the
