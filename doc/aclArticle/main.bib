  abstract = {We present two methods for unsupervised segmentation of words into
	morpheme-like units. The model utilized is especially suited for
	languages with a rich morphology, such as Finnish. The first method
	is based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle and works
	online. In the second method, Maximum Likelihood (ML) optimization
	is used. The quality of the segmentations is measured using an evaluation
	method that compares the segmentations produced to an existing morphological
	analysis. Experiments on both Finnish and English corpora show that
	the presented methods perform well compared to a current state-of-the-art
	system.},
